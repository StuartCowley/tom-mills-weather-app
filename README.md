# Weather App

This is my first project as part of the front-end module of the Manchester Codes software development bootcamp.

In this project I have built a Weather App user interface, developing my skills in React along the way.

This app fetches data from the Manchester Codes weather API based on a user search of UK cities.

## Installation

Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/tdot124/weather-app

```

Install depencies

```
npm install
```

To start weather app move to the weather app folder and type

```
npm start
```

You can run the tests by typing

```
npm test
```

## Using Weather App

The default city is Manchester. You can use the search box to search for a city in the UK you would like the forecast for. If the app cannot find the city you are looking for it will display an error message.
